## Installation

This theme works with **Ghost 0.4** or newer.

If you are using [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org)'s Pro platform, follow the instructions at [http://support.ghost.org/upload-theme-ghostpro/](http://support.ghost.org/upload-theme-ghostpro/).

If you are hosting your own Ghost installation, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/arjunjain/bhoot/releases/) and download a release.
2. If you are hosting your own Ghost installation, unzip the tarball file into `content/themes/`.
3. Restart Node. How you do this will depend on your actual server setup.
4. Login into your blog, go to `Settings` and pick up `Bhoot` from the `Theme` dropdown.

## Configuration

**You need to upload cover and logo images for your blog** or this theme will look extremely ugly! Seriously!

If you need to change some wording, etc. you can edit the files with `.hbs` extension. These are Handlebars templates and they contain:

- `default.hbs`: A wrapper for all the other templates.
- `index.hbs`: What gets rendered in the home
- `page.hbs`: What gets rendered when you are viewing a static page.
- `post.hbs`: What gets rendered when you are viewing a single post.
- `tag.hbs`: What gets rendered when you are filtering posts by tags.
- `author.hbs`: What gets rendered when you are filtering posts by author.
- `partials/header.hbs`: What gets rendered as the header and menu
- `partials/footer.hbs`: What gets rendered as the footer
